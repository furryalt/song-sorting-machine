# song-sorting-machine
a python script for sorting everything a selected artist has ever said into alphabetical order
thats right, EVERYTHING, well...
as long as by everything you mean an artist that can be found on genius.com....
and that has their lyrics properly sorted out

the code can now run by itself, no choosing files manually
it also now contains a non automatic version of the sorting thing
just run rerive.py

my friend dosent understand how hard making a ui for an app is so next update down the pipeline is that

If the coding is bad,
even terrible at times,
this is my first proper endevour into actual coding for a purpose.
i tried to keep my copying from the internet to a minimum, but there is some thevery in there right now.
though i do want to say its just theivery from the proper api site, how else would i know to do "for song in artist.songs:"

for this to run you will need:
python3,
pip,
lyricsgenius,
500g butter,
and a reason to run some kids code off the internet,

it has no viruises i promise
well i cant promise that, something may have latched itself to this code that im not aware of
but if there is a viruis on here all responsibility is on you
its not _my_ fault you went ran my code all dilly dally over the internet, did you not listen to your IT teachers?
they warned you about this didnt they?
"dont run a strangers code"
but you didnt listen did you?

anyway, i have no idea why you are here for this
why you want an artists songs sorted into alphabetical order
this started off so i could splice freddy mercury lyrics together
but  for some reason i had to also include searching artists
i might include individual songs search later idk
