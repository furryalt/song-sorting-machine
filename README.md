# song-sorting-machine
a python script for sorting everything a selected artist has ever said into alphabetical order
thats right, EVERYTHING, well...
as long as by everything you mean an artist that can be found on genius.com....
and that has their lyrics properly sorted out

im currently working on this app but school is back so i may be uploading to it less often, currently in the roster to be added, we have:
a GUI
song names being displayed with the sorted output so you can know which song is which
individual song searching

so in this most recent upload, ive added two options.
a tickbox for individual files as your output
a tickbox for wther to just download plain song lyrics with no sort

for this to run you will need:
python3,
pip,
lyricsgenius,
225g butter,
225g sugar,
4 large eggs,
225g flour,
a large preferably golden, diamond laced spoon,
and a reason to run some kids code off the internet,

i have no idea why you are here for this

why do you want an artists songs sorted into alphabetical order

whats wrong with you?
