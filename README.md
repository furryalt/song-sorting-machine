# song-sorting-machine
a python script for sorting everything a selected artist has ever said into alphabetical order
thats right, EVERYTHING, well...
as long as by everything you mean an artist that can be found on genius.com....
and that has their lyrics properly sorted out

as of right now you need to run all parts manualy 
thats because i still need to add stuff
in fact its basically just fully unfinished
the only reason its on github is so i can get the api key

If the coding is bad,
even terrible at times,
this is my first proper endevour into actual coding for a purpose.
i tried to keep my copying from the internet to a minimum, but there is some thevery in there right now.
though i do want to say its just theivery from the proper api site, how else would i know to do "for song in artist.songs:"

for this to run you will need:
python3
pip
lyricsgenius
500g butter
and a reason to run some kids code off the internet
it has no viruises i promise
well i cant promise that, something may have latched itself to this code that im not aware of
but if there is a viruis on here all responsibility is on you
its not _my_ fault you went ran my code all dilly dally over the internet, did you not listen to your IT teachers?
they warned you about this didnt they?
"dont run a strangers code"
but you didnt listen did you?

anyway, i have no idea why you downloaded this
why you want an artists songs sorted into alphabetical order
this started off so i could splice freddy mercury lyrics together
but  for some reason i had to also include searching artists
i might include individual songs search later idk
